          <summary>Do I need a lead inspection for my rental property?</summary>
          <div>
            If your Cleveland rental property was built before 1978 and a child under 6 lives there (or could live there), you need a valid Lead-Safe Certificate or 20-Year Exemption. The City of Cleveland requires this for all pre-1978 rentals.

        <details class="faq">
          <summary>What is the 2-year Lead-Safe Certificate?</summary>
          <div>
            It's issued after a risk assessment shows your property is free of lead hazards (or hazards have been properly controlled). It's valid for 2 years, after which you need a new assessment. This is the standard compliance pathway for most rental properties.

        <details class="faq">
          <summary>What is the 20-Year Lead-Safe Exemption?</summary>
          <div>
            If a full lead-based paint inspection finds no lead-based paint on any surface, your property qualifies for a 20-year exemption from regular inspections. This is the most cost-effective long-term option but requires testing every single painted surface.

        <details class="faq">
          <summary>How do I submit my report to the city?</summary>
          <div>
            Cleveland rental property reports are submitted through the city's Citizen Access online portal. Reports must be submitted within 90 days of the inspection. We format our reports for direct submission and can walk you through the portal process.

          <summary>What if lead hazards are found?</summary>

            Don't panic &mdash; most hazards can be addressed with interim controls like specialized cleaning, repainting, or minor repairs.

            Yes. After any lead hazard control work (interim controls or abatement), a clearance exam must be performed before the area can be re-occupied. This involves dust wipe sampling to verify the work was effective.

            Yes, tenants can remain in the property during the inspection. We just need access to all rooms. For clearance exams after remediation work, the treated areas must be unoccupied until clearance is achieved.

          <div>
            A Lead-Safe Certificate (from a risk assessment) is valid for 2 years. A 20-Year Lead-Safe Exemption (from a full lead-based paint inspection with no lead found) is valid for 20 years. Clearance letters don't expire but apply only to the specific work performed.
