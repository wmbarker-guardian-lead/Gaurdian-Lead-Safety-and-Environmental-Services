          <summary>How long does an inspection take?</summary>
          <div>
            Most single-family homes take 1&ndash;2 hours on-site. Multi-unit properties vary &mdash; a duplex might take 2&ndash;3 hours, while a 10-unit building could take a full day. We'll give you a time estimate when you schedule.
          </div>
        </details>
        <details class="faq">
          <summary>What does the inspector actually do?</summary>
          <div>
            Our ODH-licensed inspector performs a visual assessment of all painted surfaces, takes XRF readings to detect lead in paint, collects dust wipe samples from floors and window areas, and documents everything with photographs. For risk assessments, we also inspect exterior surfaces and may sample soil.
          </div>
        </details>
        <details class="faq">
          <summary>How soon do I get my report?</summary>
          <div>
            Standard turnaround is 10&ndash;14 days from the site visit. This includes 5&ndash;7 business days for lab processing plus report preparation time. Rush lab options are available when you need results faster.

        <details class="faq">
          <summary>What's the difference between a risk assessment and an inspection?</summary>
          <div>
            A lead-based paint inspection tests every painted surface to determine if lead-based paint is present &mdash; it's used for the 20-year exemption pathway. A risk assessment evaluates actual hazard conditions (deteriorating paint, friction surfaces, dust levels) and provides recommendations &mdash; it's required for the 2-year Lead-Safe Certificate.

        <details class="faq">
          <summary>Do I need a lead inspection for my rental property?</summary>
          <div>
            If your Cleveland rental property was built before 1978 and a child under 6 lives there (or could live there), you need a valid Lead-Safe Certificate or 20-Year Exemption. The City of Cleveland requires this for all pre-1978 rentals.
          </div>
        </details>
        <details class="faq">
          <summary>What is the 2-year Lead-Safe Certificate?</summary>
          <div>
            It's issued after a risk assessment shows your property is free of lead hazards (or hazards have been properly controlled). It's valid for 2 years, after which you need a new assessment. This is the standard compliance pathway for most rental properties.
          </div>
        </details>
        <details class="faq">
          <summary>What is the 20-Year Lead-Safe Exemption?</summary>
          <div>
            If a full lead-based paint inspection finds no lead-based paint on any surface, your property qualifies for a 20-year exemption from regular inspections. This is the most cost-effective long-term option but requires testing every single painted surface.
          </div>
        </details>
        <details class="faq">
          <summary>How do I submit my report to the city?</summary>
          <div>
            Cleveland rental property reports are submitted through the city's Citizen Access online portal. Reports must be submitted within 90 days of the inspection. We format our reports for direct submission and can walk you through the portal process.
          </div>
        </details>
        <details class="faq">
          <summary>What happens if I don't comply?</summary>
          <div>
            Cleveland can issue citations, fines, and ultimately condemn non-compliant rental properties. Compliance deadlines are enforced &mdash; it's much more cost-effective to be proactive than to face enforcement actions.

        <details class="faq">
          <summary>How much does an inspection cost?</summary>
          <div>
            Pricing depends on property type, size, and the services needed. Single-family risk assessments, multi-unit buildings, and clearance exams each have different pricing structures. Contact us for a free quote tailored to your property.

          <summary>Is there financial help available?</summary>
          <div>
            Yes. Several programs cover part or all of inspection and remediation costs, including the Lead Safe Home Fund, City of Cleveland LHC grants, and Cuyahoga County programs. We help you identify which programs you qualify for.

          <summary>Do you offer volume pricing for multiple properties?</summary>
          <div>
            Yes. Property managers with 3 or more units receive volume pricing. We also offer batch scheduling to reduce disruption and consolidated reporting for portfolio management.

        <details class="faq">
          <summary>What if lead hazards are found?</summary>
          <div>
            Don't panic &mdash; most hazards can be addressed with interim controls like specialized cleaning, repainting, or minor repairs. Your report will specify exactly which components need attention and recommend the most cost-effective approach. Full abatement (permanent removal) is also an option.
          </div>
        </details>
        <details class="faq">
          <summary>Do I need a clearance exam after repairs?</summary>
          <div>
            Yes. After any lead hazard control work (interim controls or abatement), a clearance exam must be performed before the area can be re-occupied. This involves dust wipe sampling to verify the work was effective.
          </div>
        </details>
        <details class="faq">
          <summary>Can tenants stay during the inspection?</summary>
          <div>
            Yes, tenants can remain in the property during the inspection. We just need access to all rooms. For clearance exams after remediation work, the treated areas must be unoccupied until clearance is achieved.
          </div>
        </details>
        <details class="faq">
          <summary>How long is my certification valid?</summary>
          <div>
            A Lead-Safe Certificate (from a risk assessment) is valid for 2 years. A 20-Year Lead-Safe Exemption (from a full lead-based paint inspection with no lead found) is valid for 20 years. Clearance letters don't expire but apply only to the specific work performed.
