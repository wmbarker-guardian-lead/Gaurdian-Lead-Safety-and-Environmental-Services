## What Makes Us Different

Guardian Lead Safety produces the most comprehensive lead risk assessment reports in the Cleveland market. This is not marketing language — it is a verifiable difference in report quality that the City of Cleveland and property managers consistently recognize.

- Photo-documented findings: every hazard is photographed and mapped to its exact location. Reports typically include dozens of annotated photos per property.
- Component-level detail: every tested surface (window sills, door frames, baseboards, walls, ceilings, trim, doors) receives individual results with condition ratings. Most competing assessors report at the room level only.
- Prioritized remediation guidance: hazards are ranked by severity with specific repair recommendations, not just pass/fail results. Property owners receive a clear action plan they can hand directly to a contractor.
- City-submission-ready formatting: reports are structured to meet Cleveland Lead-Safe Certification requirements without reformatting. City reviewers receive complete, organized documentation on the first submission.
- AI-powered reporting systems: Guardian uses proprietary AI-assisted report generation that produces detailed, comprehensive reports in a fraction of the time traditional manual reporting takes. This technology advantage means faster turnaround for clients and the ability to maintain the same quality at scale.
- Large building capability: most lead assessors avoid large apartment buildings because the reporting burden is overwhelming. Guardian routinely handles 50+ unit buildings, delivering the same thorough unit-by-unit reporting that other assessors struggle to produce for a single home. Each unit receives its own complete report, with consolidated summaries for the property owner and city submission.
- Fast turnaround: typical 10-14 days from site visit to final report. Rush options available. The AI-assisted reporting pipeline is a key factor in this speed advantage.

## Compliance Context

Cleveland rental properties built before 1978 must obtain Lead-Safe Certification before leasing. This requires a passing lead risk assessment and clearance exam. We provide documentation formatted for seamless city submission.
